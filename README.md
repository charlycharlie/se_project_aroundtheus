### Overview  

* description of this project - This project is a page that shows 6 beautiful locations around the world, each with their own card and the ability to like them. in this project the page was made so that it can be displayed between mobile and pc display and everything in between seamlessly. Some of the new techniques that were learned to achieve that was something called grid template column.
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
